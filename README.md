# Snapshot Watch
I've copied Darron's project (https://github.com/darrencroton/SnapshotWatch) and will try to downgrade it to SDK 1.3 for the Forerunner 235.

A clean, simple, and elegant analogue watch face for the Forerunner 735XT that plots a heart rate graph of your last 4 hours in the background.

In addition, most of your daily data is shown in an unobtrusive way: day and date, current/minimum/maximum heart rate, steps and step goal, sunrise/sunset, and icons for notification count/bluetooth/alarms/do not disturb. 

The heart rate graph and information can be turned off in the settings, and a second digital time (with or without offset) turned on.

Snapshot Watch can be downloaded to your device here: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/20b5e4c9-382c-429d-91fa-199869c4777b.

A special thanks to haraldh/SunCalc, from whom i borrowed code to calculate sunrise and sunset times: https://github.com/haraldh/SunCalc.
